List of token infomation and logos for [Dogeshrek's](https://dogeshrek.com) Community-Based Decentralized Exchange on [Dogechain](https://dogechain.dog)!


## How to Submit your Token

Create a commit in ./tokens/addresses creating a folder with your token's Dogechain contract address, in it containing your token's **transparent** background **logo.png** no larger than **100x100px**! It's required that your token has at least some liquidity on Dogeshrek and that the project's main liquidity is **locked** for a reasonable period of time.

New tokens will be added on a weekly basis as long as the project has a **safe** contract with its code **verified** on [Dogechain Explorer](https://explorer.dogechain.dog). For faster consideration leave a link to your project's Telegram group or your admin's Telegram handle in the commit description. To expedite the process you may join our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/DogeshrekChat) and let us know you made a commit with your logo.

## Farming Pool Consideration

After your token has been vetted/whitelisted you can contact us on our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/dogeshrekchat) to discuss getting your project added to the farming or staking pools. In return it's appreciated that projects promote the new pool in their project's Telegram and Twitter page, properly linking to Dogeshrek's website and Telegram in case anyone needs support with accessing the pools.
